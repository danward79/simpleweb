A Very Basic Web Framework in GO

Framework... Not sure if that is correct.

This repo is a simple web app, I started to help me start to understand GO. Evolved from the tutorial at [Go's wiki][1]. I also found that this article " Approximating html/template Inheritance" helped me with getting [templates][2] working well.
